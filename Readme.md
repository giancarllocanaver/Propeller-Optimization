# **Propeller Optimization Tool** :airplane:

## *What is it?*

This tool was developed for optimizing the propulsion efficiency of aeronautical propellers. Aeronautical propellers are used as the main form of propulsion in many types of aircrafts, for over than 70 years. Propellers with high propulsion efficiency can reduce the emissions of $CO_2$ in the cruize flight.

For optimizing the propulsion efficiency, this application needs an input description of the propeller, such as the initial airfoil used, the flight condition, and the quantity of blades. After taking these informations, the application tries to modify the airfoils presented along each blade section, in an iterative process, aiming to obtain a propeller with better propulsion efficiency.
